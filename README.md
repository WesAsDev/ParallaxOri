A project which I learned how to track the X and Y positions of the mouse on the screen and link it to the CSS X and Y rotation transform using CSS perspective.

I used:
- Pure/Vanilla JavaScipt
- Pure/Vanilla CSS

---

The biggest difficulty of this project, was calculate the X and Y mouse position to X and Y Rotation of css.

I took the height and width of the browser and calculate it with the X and Y position of the mouse to turn it into a rotation
